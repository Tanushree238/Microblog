install 

sudo apt update

sudo apt install mysql-server

sudo apt install mysql_secure_installation

	set remote access to yes during mysql_secure_instalation time by pressing y 

#start mysql server
	
	service mysql start

	or

	sudo systemctl start mysql

#for restart 
	sudo systemctl restart mysql

	or 
	
	service mysql restart

#start my sql shell

	mysql -u root -p
	
	then enter your password if you set during mysql_secure_installation

# creating a new user with mysql shell

	firstly you have to enter in mysql shell

	CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
		#replace newuser with your new username and password with your password which you want to set for this user

		#insure that password include atleast one lowercase one uppercase letter one number and one special character

#granting all permitions to our new user

	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
		#replace newuser with your new username which you create before

#to apply all changes

	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


now your mysql is setup properly to run and for connect remotely

#installing required librery for making a connection in between python and mysql server

activate your project enviroment

and run these commands in yoour terminal

pip3 install pymysql

now exit mysql shell and restart it with new user by running this command in your terminal

	mysql -u newuser -p  #replace new user with your new username which your create before
		enter your password for new user

now you are in mysql shell again but logined with your new user which have all permissions one of which is remote connection which allow us to connect remotely with python flask with the help of pymysql

# create a database by following command
	create database name_of_your_database;

#exit mysql shell with command 
	exit




***************do this stuff after completing sqlalchemy with sqlite3****************** 




now only thing we have to do to connect our mysql database to flask sqlalchemy is

provide SQLALCHEMMY_DATABASE_URI by writing following command in Config class of config file of our project/app
	
	SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://your_username:your_password@localhost:3306/your_database_name'



thats it congratulations now your app is connected with your flask app
